With the assistance of his two nephews, Surendranath and Bolendranath, he established a joint-stock company named Tagore & Company in Shilaidaha. That same year, for better business prospects, Tagore & Company was relocated from Shilaidaha to Kushtia. To manage the company, the poet constructed a two-storied building in the Millpara area of the town.</p>
